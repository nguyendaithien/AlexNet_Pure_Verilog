This is my Thesis 

<span style="font-size: 120 px;">**Overview:**</span>
This project aims to design a hardware computation unit for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and implement the full AlexNet network for handwritten digit recognition. The computation unit includes a convolutional unit, max pooling, fully connected layers, and ReLU and Softmax activation functions
